# 🛡️ Pinterest Threat Modeling & GRC Risk Assessment

This is a cybersecurity case study focused on performing a **STRIDE-based threat modeling** analysis of Pinterest, with direct mapping to **NIST 800-53** and **ISO 27001** controls to bring a **GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance)** perspective to product security.
